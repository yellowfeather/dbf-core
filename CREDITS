The people who made this tool happen:

Main Authors:
===============

Björn Berg, clergyman@gmx.de: 
dbf-core and GUI

Ross Jones, ross@companyofarchers.org:
A lot of fixes and a helpful hand while porting dbf to PPC, especially MacOS X.

Mikhail Teterin
He has mainly written the code for dbf 0.7 and has improved a lot of features
dbf offers. The entire code was rewritten by him.


Contributors:
=============

My thanks go to the following persons who assist me developing this tool:

* Joachim Astel:
1998 Joachim Astel produced the first prototype of dbf in a nightly hack. 2002 I
have taken this code and wrapped more than 2500 lines of code around it.
Without Joachim dbf would not exist in the form as it does today. Parts of the
core (dbf.c) are still credited to him, although there were a lot of changes in
the last months.

* Ed Guy:
hints how to convert symbols and characters in dBASE 3 files

* Andy Jeffries, opensource@andyjeffries.co.uk:
memory leak fix, dbf now uses a constant memory of 424 KB during conversion of a
dBASE file. See CHANGELOG for more information.

* Christian Vogel, chris@obelix.hedonism.cx:
Patch which changes all occurences of "char" to "unsigned char" in codepages.h of 
dbf-0.4. This avoids many warnings about "case statement out of range"

* Dr. Georg Roesler:
SQL Export, bugfixes and code optimization


Testers:
========

I also want to thank the people who have taken the time to test dbf under several
circumstances and who stand my never-ending questions and requests for testing 
newer versions:

* Uwe Steinmann, uwe@steinmann.cx: PPC
* Kai Witte, kai@witte-offline.de: PPC
* John McVeagh: AIX
